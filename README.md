# CouchDB demo

It's been a while since I last used CouchDB, so a quick project acting as a refresher for me and
a features demo for others.

## To run and start playing

```bash
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

And you can also access Fauxton at http://localhost:5984/_utils to play around
